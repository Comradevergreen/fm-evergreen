 * counts (they do not see the flash cache: 0.9.10's crackle, 0.9.13's EXPLORE budget). Each block (CTL samples,
 * 725 us = PRF_BLK ticks) the sections below are timed where they run; a second of them (344 halves) is summed and
 * kept, the last second while stopped and the last while playing apart (prf_win[0] / [1]): the mean and the worst
 * block of each, in % of a block (ui_menu.c prof_document). Off until PROFILE is first opened (prf_on): the marks
 * still read the timer (a load each), only the sums wait for it. The host has no timer: all 0 (tests set them) */
